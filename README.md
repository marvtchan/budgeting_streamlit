# Budgeting Streamlit Dashboard

This is an extension of my Budgeting Project.

Using Streamlit, we can now interact with personal financial data and explore with a multitude of ways. 

The SQLite transaction database is connected to this page and analyses are created from the query.

The variables will directly guide the bar chart and also filter for the dataset being analyzed.

A preview of the filtered data and raw data is also shown:
